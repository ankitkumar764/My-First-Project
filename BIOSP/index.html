            <p class="heading">What is Alternative Splicing? </p>
                In human DNA, approximately 20,000 genes code for hundreds of thousands of distinct proteins required
                for normal tissue development and function. This is possible because a single gene can translate into
                multiple protein variants, with distinct and sometimes opposing function, through a dynamic and heavily
                regulated mechanism known as alternative pre-mRNA splicing, commonly known as alternative splicing.</p>

                <p class="heading">Alternative pre-mRNA Splicing and Disease</p>
                Alternative splicing regulates genome potential by differentially joining or skipping gene segments at alternative splice sites. The resulting proteome diversification is a fundamental physiological aspect of tissue fate and function. Conversely, dysregulated alternative splicing can be a root cause of developmental disorders, tissue degeneration and cancer.
